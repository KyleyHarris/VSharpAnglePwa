# VStickAngle
A program written to run in a GNU/Linux Bash Terminal, that helps you adjust and find the angle of V-Stick type knife sharpeners. 

This is a program for V-Stick/CrockStick/Spyderco Sharpmaker type knife sharpeners. I also added a Passes Per Side function that counts the total passes per side when using a decreasing passes per side ei 30, 20, 10 ect.

This program does five things.

Calculate how to change the angle of the V-Sticks by rotating the base of the sharpener.

Calculate how to change the angle of the V-Sticks by elevation one side of the sharpener.

Display a chart of rotation angles.

Calculate the angle of the edge bevel, per side, of the knife.

Counts the total passes per side when using a decreasing passes per side ei 30, 20, 10 ect.

Use:

1)
To calculate the rotation angle, when prompted enter the desired angle per side you want, 
then enter the angle per side of the V-Stick.

2)
To calculate the elevation angle, when prompted enter the desired angle per side you want, 
then enter the angle per side of the V-Stick. 'Near' for the sticks is defined as the stick nearest to the side being elevated. 
'Far' for the sticks is defined as the stick furthest from the side being elevated. 
For the base of the sharpener, 'Near' is the side closest to the V-Sticks, 'Far' is the side furthest from the sticks. 
This is assuming the base has the sticks mounted on one side (usully beacause there are two angle settings, or a handhold), 
and not in the center.  It can work if the sticks are in the center also.

3)
To display a chart of the angles and what rotation can be use to achieve a certain angle, 
type in the angle per-side angle of the V-Stick.

4)
To estimate the edge angle per side of the knife blade, measure the thickness/width right behind the edge bevel. 
Then measure the height of the edge bevel.  

5) 
Enter the starting number of passes per side. The number should be larger than 10.
